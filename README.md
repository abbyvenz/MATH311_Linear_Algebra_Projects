# MATH311_Linear_Algebra_Projects

This is a respository of projects for the MATH 311 linear algebra course at Winona State University. It uses Google Colab and coding in Python to explore linear algebra concepts. 

# Projects:
1. Solving Systems of Equations
   Using computation and Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) to solve systems of equations.

3. Using the Gram-Schmidt Process with Polynomial Function Spaces
   Turning a random basis into an orthonormal basis and finding some functions from that orthonormal basis.

4. Ranking Sports Teams using Matrix Computations
   Along with a rank, the final computation allows one to determine who would win, and by how much, in a single game match-up.
